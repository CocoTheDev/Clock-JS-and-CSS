#  Clock Project - CSS & JS (Vanilla) - (8h) 
####  GitHub  Page : [https://cocothepimp.github.io/Clock-JS-and-CSS/](https://cocothepimp.github.io/Clock-JS-and-CSS/)
  
##  Goals and  origins  of the  project :  
This  project  comes from  [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/).  
**JavaScript30**  is  a free 30  days  challenge, 1  project  per  day, only vanilla Js.  
  
My purpose of doing this challenge, is to **understand the fundamentals of JavaScript** before working with frameworks. I  came  from Ruby and  Php, so  front  is 'new' for me, although  I  did  little  project  in Js.  
  
##  Always push  creativity :  
I  don't like  following  tutorial, and  stop  the project right after. I'm always trying to add something that I judge important. 
In this  case,  I  added  a function to **change the background in relation of the time of the day** (morning, afternoon, night, there's 6 hooks).  Also I made a **color animation for the clock's background**, and **display date and time**.
  
  
##  Things  that  challenges  me :  
- Background image moves when I tried to center the clock (fixed by "height: 100vh")
- Making the clock most design as possible (i'm not designer ok ? haha)
- Find a method to refreshing clock, wich cost less resources as possible (the best way can be: call one time the date() methode, and then increment a counter for seconds minutes and hours rotation, otherwise calling date() each second to refresh the clock)
- Tried to add an arrow with clip path at the end of each hands, but didn't manage to rotate it
- Save my time and not spend it on making this little project responsive
  
##  What I  learned  *-little  things matter  too* :  
- **CSS shapes**, how to make triangles, circles, **clip-path**)
- Refresh my mind about **::after & ::before** 
- **Transform origin** 
- **Background-blend-mode: multiply** (fusion of different image in the background, so you can overlay an image)
- **Animation** in css with keyframes
- Use **Node.textContent** rather than InnerHTML
